# dwe::calc_sci_pixel

# About
dwe::calc_sci_pixel is a GUI for dwe::calc_sci built with olcPixelGameEngine.  
It provides simple graphical interface.  
Based on 'x' parameter functionality provided by dwe::calc_sci dwe::calc_sci_pixel can draw a plot for you.

## Examples
* equation: 2*2+2  
result: 6

* equation: 2x+x^2  
x: 0,10  
result -> drawing plot for x <0, 10>

* equation: 2x+x^2  
x: 0,10,5  
result -> drawing plot for x <0, 10> in 5 steps, except for the start point, for x = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# Licencing

dwe::calc_sci_pixel is released under the DWE-3 license. This is very similar to the BSD-3 license, but there are two slight changes. You must credit `dweorh` in a visible way, in both source code and binary form, so if your application makes use of this code, somewhere in there it must display that you have used it. `dweorh` makes these tools with the intention that they are fun and educational, and does so for no profit at all.
